# Desktop hackintosh with OpenCore

### Status: Maintenance

Two config files are provided - one for system with a dedicated GPU and another one for iGPU only.

Compatibility is great, as the hardware closely resembles that of iMac 18,1 or 18,3. Onboard audio isn't configured, since I use a USB DAC. Wi-Fi and bluetooth are supported natively, so AirDrop and Continuity work out of the box.

Currently running:

## DRM

To fix broken AppleTV+, run `defaults write com.apple.AppleGVA gvaForceAMDKE -boolean yes` in the terminal. This setting enables the AMD GPU hardware decoder.

DRM does not work in Safari as of Big Sur, but works in Chromium-based browsers and browsers that use software-based DRM, so Netflix will work in Chrome but not Safari.

Note that the DRM fix will probably break your built-in screen recording, to fix you can run `defaults write com.apple.AppleGVA gvaForceAMDKE -boolean no` which disables the DRM fix.
