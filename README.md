# Desktop hackintosh with OpenCore

### Status: Maintenance

Compatibility is great, as the hardware closely resembles that of iMac 18,1 or 18,3. Onboard audio isn't configured, since I use a USB DAC. Wi-Fi and bluetooth are supported natively, so AirDrop and Continuity work out of the box.

Currently running:

| OpenCore      | 0.7.4       |
